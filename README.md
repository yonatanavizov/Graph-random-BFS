# Graph-random-BFS
random graph generator that check distance and other things 
The following is a Graphs algorithym to check the optimization of travesing graphs quickly. Given a 1000 noded graph that is created via randomness it checks to see if the graph is connected.
It does this for 500 graphs checking the probability of they are connected, with a lone node, their max distance is below 2, and so on .
